# Advanced-Classification-Techniques

In this project, I'm performing feature engioneerig on categorical and nominal data to encode them for classification.

The data is masked bio data. I have applied various classification algorithms and compared F1 score, precision, and recall for them. Further I have approached the problem of imbalanced data using SMOTE and other oversampling techniques.
